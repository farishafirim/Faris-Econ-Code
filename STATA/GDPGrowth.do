*The graph in 1.5 is easier to interpret because the relationship between x axis and y axis is clearly linear, while the relationship in 1.4 is linear at first but as x goes up, the value increase of y is decreasing. It is more like a log curve. That is why changing the variables to log curve make them linear.

*PPP conversion larger than XR conversion -> the further away above the x=y line:
* Kyrgyzstan, Ghana, Ethiopia, Congo, Dem. Rep. of the, Tajikistan
 
*PPP conversion smaller than XR conversion -> under the x=y line:
* Sweden, Congo, Switzerland, Norway, Japan

*Question 1.8
*The general trend is that as countries become wealthier, the GDP per capita with PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) conversion tends to be smaller relative to GDP per capita with exchange rate (XR) conversion. In other words, while poorer countries have a significantly higher GDP per capita using PPP conversion compared to XR conversion, this disparity shrinks in wealthier countries. In fact, in richer nations, the GDP per capita using PPP conversion is often nearly the same as or slightly lower than the XR conversion.

*The economic reason behind this pattern lies in the differences in the cost of living. In poorer countries, the cost of living is usually much lower than in wealthier countries, which makes the purchasing power of the people higher relative to the exchange rate. As a result, GDP per capita with PPP conversion is inflated compared to XR conversion. However, in wealthier countries, the higher cost of living reduces the relative advantage of PPP adjustments, as goods and services are more expensive, and people's income is spent on higher-priced items. Consequently, the gap between GDP per capita using PPP and XR conversion narrows or even reverses slightly in richer countries.

graph export graph2_3.pdf, replace

*Question 2.4
*Graphs 2.2 and 2.3 show that GDP per capita is associated with other key development indicators, such as infant mortality and adult literacy, which are often considered important by people. This suggests that GDP per capita can serve as a good measure of development, as it appears to summarize many other preferred indicators.

*However, in this analysis, we have not yet fully explored the relationship between GDP and other variables to verify the generalization made earlier. Additionally, I observed that the predictive power of GDP varies across different variables: for example, the deviation in the adult literacy vs. GDP graph is larger than in the infant mortality graph, suggesting that adult literacy cannot be predicted solely by GDP.

*While it is reasonable to consider GDP as a "main" indicator of development due to its ability to predict other variables, I believe it would be more effective to aggregate additional indicators in the analysis. GDP alone is not a perfect predictor, and including other factors would provide a more comprehensive view of development.

*Question 4.6.
*From the regression in 4.5, we found that in 1960-1999, GDP in 1960 does not have a significant association with GDP growth between 1960-1999 (p>.05). However, GDP in 2000 has a significant relationship with GDP growth. Specifically, countries with bigger starting GDP in 2000 experienced less growth (p<.05). In the case of absolute convergence, we would expect poorer countries to grow faster than richer ones, leading to a reduction in income disparities across countries. This is the case in the 2000-2019 where poorer countries experienced bigger growth, but not the case for our results in 1960-1999.
